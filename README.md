Idea_App
========

In this app you can add your ideas in the box given and store it. You will also be able to store images.

You should first of all, run the rails server in your system (assumed that you have installed rails :) ). If you haven't setup rails in your system then you can check this link - http://mastro77.blogspot.in/2014/03/creating-your-first-app-using-ruby-in.html.

$ rails server  #set up your rails server

After that you need to run this in your local host.

And it is all ready.

Now you can enjoy the idea app!!! :)
